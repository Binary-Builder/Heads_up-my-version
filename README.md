-A charades-inspired game project, developed as my version of ‘Heads Up,’ with culturally relevant categories-

Hey! This is a personal project that has been in my mind for a long time.
The purpose of this project is to create my own version of the well-known ‘Heads Up’ game, which is essentially a charades-style game featuring different themes. One limitation I noticed in the original game is the limited number of categories, which reduces the variety and fun. My aim is to design a version that feels more relatable to Indian audiences by introducing themes that resonate with us. While I am not certain if this project will reach completion, I’m excited to explore the idea — and encouragement along the way would certainly help!
