// hello you curious peep !! //

So basically the reason why i started this is because im planning on making my own version of the pretty famous "Heads up" game. 
which is just a kind of charades game with different themes that you can choose from.
but i always hated how there were only two or three categories that we could play and really have fun with. 
i wanted it to be a bit more relatable to us indian audiences, so here i am trying to imitate it and make my own version that i can enjoy. 
i don't know if i'll ever complete this, but hey keep cheering me on and maybe i will !
